# Stealth Telegram Mini App

Welcome to the Stealth Telegram Mini App. The core idea of the app is to create a bridge between patients and healthcare
professionals, providing an easy booking system for medical services via the Telegram platform.

Like 1mpal wrote on X, Telegram mini apps as gaming products are at reaching saturation. The hotball of money from web3 degens can only rotate so much. The aim of this stealth project is to leverage Telegram's widespread adoption in Singapore to be  "more accessible to traditional retailers".
